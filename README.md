# SpaceMan
Created the game using the SpriteKit library in the swift.
A player will collide with the power ups to gain 5 points and when it touches the black hole will lose 10 points. 
When 100 points collected, you won the game
When the player goes out of bound, top or bottom, the game will be over.
When the score touches zero then also the game will ve over.
